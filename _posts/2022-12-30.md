title:  "CVE 2022-3694 – Authentication Token Disclosure in WordPress plugin"

Recently, our team discovered a new vulnerability with high severity level while testing an e-commerce website powered by WordPress. The vulnerability was in the plugin called “Syncee – Global Dropshipping”. This plugin is designed for retailers to find products to sell, automate their product uploads, update product descriptions, prices, and so on. According to our team’s discovery, the plugin (version < 10.0.10) leaks the administrator token that can be used to take over the administrator’s account.

Generally, when performing security testing of WordPress websites, manual testing doesn’t result in great findings if the plugins are updated, which was the case. However, sometimes it can be useful to give it a shot. So, we started to look at the requests sent and analyze them. We noticed that the request was sent to the endpoint /wp-json/redacted/retailer/v1/getDataForFrontend, and an access token was returned in the response.

Our curiosity told us to use that token in the plugin’s web application. First, we created another account on Syncee and analyze the functionalities of the web application. Then we noticed that this token is sent in the X-Authorization header through the requests. We simply changed our token with the access token we got from the last response.

There was a functionality on the website to add team members to the account. We used that functionality to add a new team member to the account of the administrator, and then log into the application with the credentials of the new team member.

And voilà! After entering the application with the credentials, it was possible to perform operations on behalf of the administrators, such as modifying catalogs, adding/deleting/editing products, even deleting administrator accounts, and so on.

Now imagine that you are the owner of this e-commerce site. What would be the risks of such an attack against your site? After gaining control of the administrator account, attackers could damage the site by deleting the product catalog or adding inappropriate content between products. They could even destroy the site by permanently deleting the administrator accounts. Such an event can seriously damage both large and small companies financially and in terms of the company’s reputation. Therefore, making a little investment in security is the best step to take in order to prevent potentially huge losses ahead of time.
